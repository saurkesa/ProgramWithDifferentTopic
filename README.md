1) Recursion:-
HIB( Hypothesis Induction base condtion)
base condition: smallest valid input
hypothesis:---method
Induction: --logic

NOTE: first create hypotheis ( means function) then base condtion then induction( smaller input)

TRICK:- always store one element into variable then do induction( see aditya video it will clear more)

sort stack using recursion:

2) powerset ---ab------{a,b,ab} ----all subset of a set is called powerset
subset- order not matter like it is bag ----------example abc----ac ,ca (both are possbile)
subsequences----order matter and it is like chain ----------example abc---- ac possible but ca not possible
